# Diabetes Classification Project
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health indicators, using machine learning classification models.

# Project Overview
## Goal: To classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on health data.
## Data: The dataset includes attributes like age, BMI, blood pressure, and other relevant health metrics.
## Methods: Multiple classification algorithms are explored, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to find the best-performing model.

Follow the steps in the notebook to load data, preprocess it, and train the model.
Results
The notebook presents the performance of various models and highlights the most relevant features for predicting diabetes.
